# System Battery Notifier
### SERVER REQUIRED ONLY
### WINDOWS ONLY
This is a minimal mod that adds in 3 commands to check the battery percentage of the server, in case this is running on a laptop or similar.

## Commands:
- `/startbatterynotifier`: This will start the service to check the batter status once every 30 minutes.
- `/stopbatterynotifier`: This will stop the continous service checking
- `/checkbatterynotifier`: This will show if the service is currently enabled or not.
